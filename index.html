</div><div><h2>About me</h2>
<p>Hi ðŸ‘‹, my name is Jasper, and I am Belgian web developer who lives in Nijlen, a small town in the Kempen. Coding and
working together in a team towards a common goal are my greatest passions. Those became a reality when I started my
education as a web developer at the Karel de Grote Hogeschool in Antwerp and on the volleyball court of my local club. I
like to create things that will give my team the extra push to achieve our goals!</p>

<h3>Web developer</h3>
<h4>Digiti | Oct 2017 - Present</h4>
<p>Trying to create a bigger impact on the team and the customer, I decided to join a much smaller company. They gave me
the opportunity to enrich my skills by learning and using React Native, as well as more responsibilities as it comes to
working together with the client.</p>
<h3>Web developer</h3>
<h4>Intracto (now IO) | Dec 2013 - Oct 2017</h4>
<p>Original's growth and know-how did not go unnoticed: first we became part of Nivario, and afterwards we joined Intracto
as a full-blown Drupal-team. I learned how to navigate a larger chain of command and how to work together with other
teams who have their own area of expertise.</p>
<h3>Drupal developer</h3>
<h4>Original | Aug 2012 - Dec 2013</h4>
<p>A successful internship was rewarded with a much appreciated job offer, which I gladly accepted! The other colleagues,
but especially Gunter Van Steen, really made me feel like this was the place I belonged.</p>

<h3>Internship around Drupal</h3>
<h4>Original | Apr 2012 - Aug 2012</h4>
<p>Together with Christophe De Ruyter, we were able to understand and use the Drupal framework. First, we created an
internal project. The successful delivery of it was rewarded with an actual case with a real client.</p>
<h3>Multimedia and CommunicationTechnology (MCT)</h3>
<h4>Karel de Grote Hogeschool, Antwerp | 2009 - 2012</h4>
<p>Professional bachelor degree, Web &#x26; UX track.</p>
<h3>High school</h3>
<h4>Sint-Ursulalyceum, Lier | 2003 - 2009</h4>
<p>Science and Math track.</p>

<p>When I am not sitting behind my desk, you can usually find me in the kitchen. I love to eat, drink and cook, whether it
is desserts or some other dish. I do not have one favorite cuisine, I like to try them all! This also led to me becoming
a vegetarian during the summer of 2021. If you want to know more about this, just ask! ðŸ˜‹</p>
<p>Another passion of mine is volleyball: I started at <a href="https://smashlier.be">Smash Lier</a> when I was 12 years old and still playing there now. In
addition to playing, I also coach and train various teams.</p>
<p>I like the balance of these 3 things: food, volleyball and code. Being passionate about food allows me to play
volleyball at a high (physical) level, but it also gives me the necessary nutrition to keep my brain focussed. The hours
on the court are the perfect change of scenery between the coffee machine and the desk. The code and technical stuff
allow me to overcome various challenges, which I gladly face!</p>
